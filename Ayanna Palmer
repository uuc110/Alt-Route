# AltRoute: Finding Safer Routes Beyond Google Maps

AltRoute is a web application developed during a hackathon to address the challenge of finding safer routes that are not typically shown on Google Maps. The idea behind this project is to provide an alternative routing system that considers factors such as time of day and potential risks, offering routes that may be safer than the ones suggested by traditional navigation apps.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement for this hackathon project was to create a solution that can show alternative and safer routes that are not displayed on Google Maps. Conventional navigation apps like Google Maps often provide the same routes regardless of the time of day, which may not always be the safest option, especially during nighttime or in areas with potential security concerns.

## Features

- **Alternative Route Calculation**: AltRoute calculates alternative routes based on predefined criteria, such as time of day, crime rates in specific areas, or other safety factors.
- **Route Visualization**: The application provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the alternative routes on an interactive map, allowing users to compare them with the default routes suggested by Google Maps.
- **Route Tracking**: Users can track their progress along the selected route, with real-time updates and estimated arrival times.
- **Feedback System**: AltRoute includes a feedback system that allows users to report any issues or provide suggestions for improving the routing algorithm and enhancing the overall safety of the recommended routes.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end**: (If applicable, mention the server-side technologies used)
- **APIs**: Google Maps API, (any other relevant APIs)
- **Libraries**: (List any notable libraries or frameworks used)

## Getting Started

To run the AltRoute application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/AltRoute.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AltRoute`
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

Note: You may need to obtain API keys for certain services (e.g., Google Maps) and configure them in the project files.
